Skynet is an open protocol and toolkit for creating a better web—one built on decentralized storage and applications. Built on top of the Sia network, Skynet apps transform what’s possible on the web. Key features of decentralization such as user-owned personal data, persistent identity across apps, and censorship-resistance will be the new standards of the digital world.
